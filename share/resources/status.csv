"Code","Status","Note (Kerwin, Alulema, Tu, 2015)"
"1A","Voluntary Departure – Un-Expired and Un-Extended Voluntary Departure.","This code covers detainees granted voluntary departure who have not overstayed the period of voluntary departure. Case category code '[1B]' covers persons whose voluntary departure period has been extended. Case category code '[1C]' covers persons who overstayed their voluntary departure period."
"2A","Deportable – Under Adjudication by IJ.","This code covers detainees in pending deportation proceedings."

"3","Deportable – Administratively Final Order.","This code covers detainees with a final order of removal, including those pursuing petitions for review in federal court.8 The dataset lists 102 persons in this category who do not have a final order. This logical impossibility might best be explained by simple error."
"5B","Removable – ICE Fugitive.","This code covers detainees who were ordered removed via normal removal proceedings and subsequently absconded and were rearrested."
"5C","Relief Granted – Withholding of Deportation/Removal.","This code covers detainees granted withholding of removal."

"8C","Excludable/Inadmissible – Administrative Final Order Issued.","This code covers detainees who received a final order, including those pursuing a petition for review in federal court. This category included 160 persons who did not receive a final order, which appears to be another mistake."

"8E","Inadmissible – ICE Fugitive.","This code covers detainees who were ordered removed based on a ground of inadmissibility, and who absconded and were rearrested."

While cases are supposed to remain in the [8G] category until they receive political asylum or a final order of removal, 1,244 cases in this category had received a removal order.
