All ""baggage"" sacks were taken off the bus as usual, but at the end of the boarding, before the bags were loaded on the plane, the ground crew separated out 3 bags and put them back on the bus. We've never seen this done before. 
Thus, we believe that three people didn't pass the medical exam on the bus and are being sent back to Tacoma. Just like last week, all detainees were wearing masks and only a portion of the ""agents/ground crew"" were wearing masks. 
Also, there is new signage at the beginning of the driveway that goes back to the area where we observe the flights which states ""No Public Access from this point""; so we don't know if we may be stopped from observing the flights from that space in the future.  The building has commercial tenants (Locksmith, sign maker, etc), with retail parking in front near the road, but the end unit, next to which we observe is unoccupied and for lease, so that parking area behind the building is not being used by an active tenant.  We don't know who put the sign up and no one approached us to challenge our presence during the observation today, or in the past, at that location. "|
